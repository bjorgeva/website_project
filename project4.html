                            <p>The group decided to design and mill some piece of furniture. Inspiration was found on Icelandic design store's websites, and the conclusion was to make a sidetable, similar to the one shown in the picture below, by Norman Copenhagen.</p>

                            <p>The group decided, in consultation with the course teacher, to make the table legs with two material thicknesses, for stability. The design was also made in a way that no glue, nails or screws are needed for construction.<p/>
                            <p>Below are images of how the group imagined the mounting components, to make the legs stick together and holding up the shelves.</p>

                            <p>The final product, after drawing, can be seen below, but putting the already-drawn parts together to show the final product, was my responsibility. </p>

                            <p>Before milling any project it is important to read through the manual for the ShopBot, seen in Icelandic if button below is clicked.</p>

                            <p>The most important part is insuring that all safety measures are enforced. Those include:</p>

                            <p>After placing the wood on the ShopBot, and checking off everything on the list, the mill's x-, y- and z-axis need to be zeroed. The mill is moved to the corner of the wood with the control board and the position saved as the zero-point og x- and y-axis. A tool is then placed under the mill to zero the z-axis. Below is an image showing the control board, while the mill is in use.</p>

                            <h2>Constructing the sidetable</h2>
                            <p>Before constructing the table, the components had to be sanded. We soon realized that some errors had been made while drawing and the nail mounts did not fit the holes on the legs, and the finger joints were rather tight. The solution was to saw off a bit of the finger joints and to skip the use of the nail mounts, as the leg-holes on the shelves were tight enought for the shelves to stay in place without them. </p>
                            <img src="images/v6/sog.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="540">
                            <p>The components were put together with a hammer, as some force was needed to make them fit.</p>
                            <img src="images/v6/tol.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="540">
                            <p>The construction came together in the end, and the end result was great!</p>

                            <h2>Documentation and website programming</h2>
                            <p>My main responsibility was to document the process of the project and putting it up on the <a href="https://bjorgeva.github.io/website_project/project6.html" >Final Project site</a>. My goal was to make the website organized and accessible for those who visit. Documenting all the parts of the project required following along the other group members' work and was quite time consuming, but gave me a better insight to all parts of the project which is always good.</p>
                            <p>The site for the Final Project is set up as a tab on my website, and how it was made is shown in detail in <a href="https://bjorgeva.github.io/website_project/project1.html" >Project 1 - Making a website</a>. A new *.html file was saved in the repository folder and every time a change was implemented the website was updated as follows.<br>
                            In the terminal for the local repository type in: <code>$ git add .</code>
                            <br>
                            <br>Followed by: <code>$ git commit -m 'a describing word of the last change'</code>
                            <br>
                            <br> Where the <code>' '</code> is neccesary. 
                            <br>
                            <br>Next type: <code>$ git push</code>
                            <br>
                            <br> And the change is visible on the page in a few moments!
                            <p>
                            <p>Each design file was exported and added to the repository file of my website, as well as the video and the leaflet for the project. It is then made accessible with a button, like the files below, a link or with direct visibility on the website like the video. A useful page for all of this, called w3schools (which I used as a guide), can be visited by clicking <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp" >here.</a></p>
